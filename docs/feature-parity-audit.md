# Feature Parity Audit — VortexChat vs. Discord / Stoat

> Audited: 2026-03-18
> Auditor: Automated codebase analysis
> Scope: Full codebase scan of apps/web, packages/shared, supabase/migrations, apps/signal
> Stoat source: [github.com/stoatchat/for-web](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web) — open-source Discord alternative (formerly Revolt), Solid.js web client

Legend: **Present** = feature exists in that platform | **—** = absent or negligible

Gap severity:
- 🔴 Critical — users will notice its absence immediately
- 🟡 Nice-to-have — improves polish/retention
- 🟢 Intentional skip — out of scope for VortexChat's vision

## Top 10 Priority Items (status-tracked)

### Recently Closed

| Rank | Gap | Impact | Effort | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Inline audio/video player** | High | Low | `<audio>`/`<video>` in `message-item.tsx` |
| **2** | **Screen share with system audio** | High | Low | `audio: true` in `getDisplayMedia()` + track forwarding |
| **3** | **Notification schedule (quiet hours)** | High | Medium | `quiet-hours.ts` + migration + settings UI |
| **4** | **Screen reader `aria-live` regions for chat** | Medium | Low | `aria-live` + live announcements in `chat-area.tsx` |
| **5** | **Data export (GDPR compliance)** | High | Medium | `GET /api/users/export` + settings UI |
| **7** | **Thread auto-archive** | Medium | Low | Discord-style auto-archive with configurable durations (1h/24h/3d/1w), cron job, auto-unarchive on message send. |
| **10** | **Sticker packs** | Low | Medium | Klipy sticker API (search + trending) with tabbed picker in channels + DMs. |

Note: ranks 6, 8, and 9 are intentionally omitted here because they remain open — see the "Open Gaps" section below.

### Open Gaps

| Rank | Gap | Severity | Impact | Effort | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **6** | **Public bot API + token auth** | 🔴 | High | High | Introduce bot tokens, separate from user sessions. Critical for ecosystem growth but significant work. ~1-2 weeks. |
| **8** | **Bot SDK / library** | 🔴 | High | High | Both Discord and Stoat offer multi-language SDKs. Depends on #6 (public API). ~2-3 weeks. |
| **9** | **Raid protection (auto-detect)** | 🟡 | Medium | Medium | Discord has explicit raid mode. Extend existing automod system with join-rate detection + lockdown. ~3-5 days. |

### All 🟡 Nice-to-Have Gaps (with implementation plans)

Full implementation plans for most gaps below are in [critical-gap-implementation-plans.md](./critical-gap-implementation-plans.md).

| # | Gap | Severity | Complexity | Plan Section |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | OAuth app installs | 🟡 | M | No plan yet — Discord-style OAuth app marketplace |
| 16 | Mobile push (native app) | 🟡 | L | Gap 16 — deferred (Capacitor wrapper) |
| 17 | Zapier / Make connector | 🟡 | S | Gap 17 — depends on public API (#6) |
| 18 | OAuth2 for third-party apps | 🟡 | L | Gap 18 — OAuth2 server, depends on #6 |
| 20 | Vanity invite URLs | 🟡 | S | Gap 20 — single column + route |
| 21 | Raid protection | 🟡 | M | Gap 21 — extends automod system |
| 22 | Verification levels | 🟡 | S | Gap 22 — server setting + join gate |
