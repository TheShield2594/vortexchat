# Voice channels use Supabase Realtime (Broadcast + Presence) — no separate signal server needed

# TURN server — required for users behind strict NAT / corporate firewalls (~20% of connections)
# Deploy coturn (https://github.com/coturn/coturn) and fill these in.
# Without TURN, peer connections will silently fail for those users.
